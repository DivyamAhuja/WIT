            <h1>Associative Array in PHP</h1>
            <p style='width: 70%'>
                Associative arrays are used to store key value pairs. For example, to store the marks of different subject of a student in an array, a numerically indexed array would not be the best choice. Instead, we could use the respective subjectâ€™s names as the keys in our associative array, and the value would be their respective marks gained.
            </p>
            <?php
                $marks = array("WIT" => 100, "DAA" => 95, "MATHS" => 92, "OB" => 90, "OS" => 94);
                print_r($marks);
            ?>
